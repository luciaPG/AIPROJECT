• An analysis of the dataset: What are the characteristics of the dataset? Use PCA,
clustering, and plots to show an understanding of the dataset’s features


Algorithms
Two algorithms must be chosen in the following list. An additional one must be chosen
outside this list, from the literature.
• K Nearest Neighbors
• Decision Tree
• Generalized Linear Model
• Support Vector Machine
• Multilayer Perceptron


● Split away a “test” portion of the data immediately after importing it. Only use this set
once you are ready to test your three algorithms against each other. Use validation
splits from your training set to select hyperparameters for your algorithms. Apply the
same data cleaning procedures to all splits.
● Make sure each feature has consistent units for all samples.
● Be careful about missing data.
● Some number-based features are actually categorical, such as ID numbers and zip
codes.
● If the categories of a categorical feature don’t have any inherent ordering or relative
value, use one hot encoding.
● Use multiple random seeds to evaluate how consistent your methods are.
